This file include three file and one python script.

About
============

file1: individual_ID_informaton.txt, every sample ID and class.
file2: example_genotype.txt, the all samples' genotype file.
file3: the output results PIM_CER.snp.genotype and CER_BIG.snp.genotype (Test files).


Using extract_sample.py
============

Using extract_sample.py, we can extract genotypes of PIM-CER or CER-BIG groups.
We can just type command line just below to understand required arguments.

python3 extract_sample.py -h

usage: extract_sample.py [-h] [-input1 INPUT1] [-input2 INPUT2]
                         [-group1 GROUP1] [-group2 GROUP2] [-o O]

extracted the PIM-CER or CER-BIG genotype from the PIM-CER-BIG genotype file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -input1 INPUT1  the individual_ID informaton file
  -input2 INPUT2  the all samples genotype file
  -group1 GROUP1  the name of group1
  -group2 GROUP2  the name of group2
  -o O            The output file name

Operation
============
1) extract the PIM and CER groups' genotype
python3 extract_sample.py -input1 individual_ID_informaton.txt -input2 example_genotype.txt -group1 PIM -group2 CER -o PIM_CER.snp.genotype

2)extract the CER and BIG groups' genotype
python3 extract_sample.py -input1 individual_ID_informaton.txt -input2 example_genotype.txt -group1 CER -group2 BIG -o CER_BIG.snp.genotype
We can extract
